# Getting Started with Create React App

This SPA (Single Page Application) is created for our colleague Paula Álvarez, a sexologist and educator, and it has several sections:

- Navigation bar
- Main image
- Schedule appointments for consultations
- View the various collaborations that Paula has engaged in, along with an email option to contact her
- Links to her LinkedIn and GitHub profiles, which showcase her expertise as a data analyst and her job search
- The widgets to her podcast on Spotify and YouTube, which she co-hosts with Rocío Romero (RoEnLaRed), are regularly updated with fresh content
- Link to purchase the courses she teaches, along with a sample of course materials
- Instagram widget, which is updated in real-time as Paula posts new content
- Footer includes links to all of Paula's various social media platforms
